/*
 * REQUIREMENTS
 * 1. Your code should have a variables - `room`, `suspect`, `weapon`, and `solved`
 * 2. Your code should include a conditional statement
 * 3. The variable `suspect` should use one of the provided values
 * 4. The variable `weapon` should be based on the `room`
 * 5. Your code should produce the expected output: __________ did it in the __________ with the __________!
 * 
 *
 * 6. For unmatching combination of the suspect and the room, print nothing on the console
 */

/* ****************************************** */
/* TESTING LOGIC */
// Change the value of `room` and `suspect` to test your code

// A room can be either of - dining room, gallery, ballroom, or billiards room
var room = "billiards room";

// A suspect can be either of - Colonel Mustard, Mrs. Peacock, Professor Plum, or Ms. Scarlett
// Test your code by giving matching as well as unmatching names of the suspect
var suspect = "Colonel Mustard";

/* ****************************************** */

/* IMPLEMENTATION LOGIC*/

// Initial values
var weapon = "";
var solved = false;


if (/* your conditional goes here */) {

} else if (/* your conditional goes here */) {

} else if (/* your conditional goes here */) {

} else if (/* your conditional goes here */) {

} else {

}
/* ****************************************** */
// The code below will run only when `solved` is true
if (solved) {
    console.log(/* your message goes here*/);
    // Example: Colonel Mustard did it in the dining room with the knife!
